    Tac is a single-weight, bold San serif inspired by the wordmark of one of the most significant festivals in Africa's post-colonial history, Festac '77. It's a revival that expands upon the six lowercase letters, single quotes and number 7 in the wordmark, resulting in a full Google SSA character set. Tac is the second project from Afrotype.

    Afrotype, founded by Seyi Olusanya, intends to subvert cliches around African graphic design by creating typefaces grounded in African history and culture. David Udoh and Eyiyemi Adegbite collaborated on the design and drawing work. Tac was produced with Mirko VelimiroviÄ‡, who provided technical, drawing, and font engineering assistance.
